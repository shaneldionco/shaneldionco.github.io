            <h2>TWICE</h2>
            <p><b> Seoul-based K-pop girl group Twice features members from Korea, Japan, and Taiwan performing bright, catchy pop tunes. Their debut Twicetagram topped the Korean, Taiwanese, and U.S. World charts upon release in 2017. In 2020, they made their first appearance on the Billboard 200 with their ninth EP, More & More. Months later, they bested that showing with their sophomore full-length, Eyes Wide Open. They have reached the Top Five of the Oricon chart with each of their Japanese studio albums and again landed on the Billboard 200, hitting number three with 2022's Formula of Love: O+T=3. More Top Five Korean EPs arrived with 2022's Between 1&2 and 2023's Ready to Be.
              In September 2020, they charted even higher with their second LP, Eyes Wide Open, which was boosted by the '80s synth pop-indebted single "I Can't Stop Me." The song helped them secure their debut U.S. television appearance on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert. In October, half of the group guested on K/DA's All Out EP, joining Bekuh Boom and Annika Wells on the single "I'll Show You." Their tenth mini-album, Taste of Love, arrived in June 2021 and offered a bright, summery set of romantic anthems. Following this romantic theme, the group issued their first English-language single, "The Feels," which debuted at #12 on the Billboard Global 200 -- their highest placement thus far. A month later, they reached number two on the Oricon Albums chart with their third Japanese studio-album, Perfect World.
              The group's third Korean-language studio album, Formula of Love: O+T=3, arrived that November, a love-driven LP that became their highest-selling album to date. Celebrate, their fourth Japanese studio album, appeared in July 2022 and reached number two on the Oricon Albums chart. That August, they delivered the EP Between 1&2, which featured the single "Talk That Talk." Another EP, Ready to Be, arrived in March 2023, heralded by the singles "Set Me Free" and "Moonlight Sunrise."
