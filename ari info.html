            <h2>Ariana Grande-Butera</h2>
            <p><b>American pop singer and actress who burst onto the pop music scene in the early 2010s and became one of the genre’s most successful performers, known for her four-octave range.
                Grande began singing and acting when she was young. In 2008 she won a role in the Broadway play 13, and she soon began appearing in bit parts on television shows. Her big break came in 2010 when she landed a role on the Nickelodeon TV series Victorious.
                2011 she released the single “Put Your Hearts Up” (she later disparaged the song and music video for its teen vibe). Her debut album, Yours Truly, appeared two years later, and it included the popular single “The Way,” a collaboration with rapper Mac Miller. The album debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 chart and was widely praised.
                &nbsp;
                Like two of Grande’s three previous albums, Sweetener reached number one on the Billboard 200 chart (Dangerous Woman peaked at number two). It included the songs “God Is a Woman,” “No Tears Left to Cry,” and “The Light Is Coming,” the latter of which featured Minaj. Sweetener received widespread acclaim, and it won the Grammy for best pop vocal album. In 2019 Grande released Thank U, Next. The title track, as well as such songs as “Ghostin” and “7 Rings,” included glimpses into her personal life. Her sixth studio album, Positions, appeared in 2020. During this time, Grande also sang on other artists’ tracks, and her collaboration with Lady Gaga on “Rain on Me” (2020) resulted in her second Grammy Award, for best pop duo/group performance. In 2021 Grande became a coach on the televised singing competition The Voice.</b></p>
